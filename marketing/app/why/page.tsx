      <h1>Why Carbon</h1>
      <p>
        The founders of Carbon worked at various manufacturing companies over
        the years and saw the same problems repeatedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As software became cloud-based, the software landlords started to
        increase costs over time. You had to play by their rules. Every
        customization would require working with a &apos;Software
        Consultant&apos;
      </p>
      <p>
        We realized it was time for change. Rather than charging outrageous
        license and consultancy fees, we decided to make the software
        open-source. Rather than just being a tenant, you now OWN the software.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you are a company that doesn&apos;t want to deal with the hosting
        IT, we can help you get started with the deployment and support.
