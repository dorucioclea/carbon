The [Elastic License](https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon/blob/main/LICENSE) is a software license that has one restriction: you can't sell a hosted version of the software. Other than that you can do anything you want with it. Most importantly, you can develop your own internal business systems on top of it without an obligation to make them open-source.

There are some open-source purists who will say that the Elastic License is not "open source" (because there is a limited on what you can do with it), so out of respect for these guys, you'll see us referring to our software as "source available" instead of "open source".

We think this is a good choice for three reasons:

1. We want people to use our ERP as a starting point for their proprietary business systems
2. We want people to learn from and improve the code
3. We want to create a sustainable long-term business
